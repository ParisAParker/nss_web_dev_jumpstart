  <!--  DIRECTION 1: Give the body a 'lightblue' background. Also add a padding value of 20px to the body to move content away from the sides of the browser window.  -->
    
  <!--  DIRECTION 2: Turn our current h1 page title into a dark header with light text by making our current text color of 'steelblue' the background color of our h1 instead. Then change the main font color to white. Create a little space in the new header by adding 10px of padding.  -->
    
  <!--  DIRECTION 3: Let's work on the image in the "left-column" div container.
     First, you'll notice that the photo runs off the side of the page.
      Let's bring that in by giving the image a width of 100% (this means 100% of its parent content area).
       Then give the image inside of this div a border with a size, style, and color of your choosing. -->
    
 <!--  DIRECTION 4: Now let's make a change to the container itself to prepare for changing our page layout.
    Write a CSS rule that gives the "left-column" div a width of 60% of the screen. -->
    <div class="left-column">
      <h1>There's Always Money in the Banana Stand</h1>
      <img src="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/arresteddevelopment/images/6/67/1x05_Charity_Drive_%2810%29.png">
    </div>
    
  <!--  DIRECTION 5: Now let's create some simulated columns on our page.
     We can use the "float" property to begin to create these columns by floating the "left-column" div to the left.
      This will allow the content in the "float-me-right" div to come up and sit on the right.
       Then, if we give the "float-me-right" column a width of 35% and float it to the right, it will appear that we now have a two-column layout! -->
    
  <!--  DIRECTION 6: Let's take our selector for the divs with the class of "container" and add more CSS properties to make things look nicer!
     First, create vertical space between the three selected content boxes by adding a margin of 20px to the bottom of each.
      Then, let's move the content away from the sides of each div by adding 20px 0f padding to the left and right sides. -->
    <div class="float-me-right">
      <div class="container" id="companyValues">
        <h2>Company Values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Always money</li>
          <li>No slacking off</li>
          <li>No stealing bananas</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <!--  DIRECTION 7: Let's also create a consistent appearance in our text by making any h2 that is a descendant of class "container" the same Google font as the h1 above.  -->
      
      <div class="container" id="aboutCompany">
        <h2>About Our Company</h2>
      
        <p>I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's the belle of the ball! Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! This one really cracks me up for some reason. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. </p>

        <p>She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. Are all the guys in here… you know? George Sr: No not all of them. Barry: Yeah. It's never the ones you hope. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months.</p>
      
        <p>There's a girl in my soup! No borders, no limits… go ahead, touch the Cornballer… you know best? You're a good guy, mon frere. That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. "Circumvent." It means "to go around."</p>

    <!--  DIRECTION 8: Finally, even up the tops of the two columns of content by giving the h1 a top margin of 0px.
       Then add some space between each input box in this form below by adding a margin of 10px to the bottom of each div with the class of "form-input".
